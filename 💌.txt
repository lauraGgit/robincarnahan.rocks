That time Robin texted Howard Dean from the Vermont statehouse to heckle him about his official portrait.
This is another story.
So you can see, one story per line, and they will get picked at random.
I got to meet up with Robin for dinner in Portland, and she taught me about aged beef, something I knew nothing about. That was just one of probably a hundred times Robin taught me about something I knew very little about. Always in the most straightforward manner, delivered with passion and conviction (whether about state IT budgets or aged beef). - Hannah
Robin's ability to have a lunch or dinner buddy anywhere taught me to make the most of the opportunities we have to travel and connect with great people. Also, she always knows where to go and what to order. 
I got sent an anonymous stuffed animal capybara to your federal workplace and awkwardly texting your on-again/off-again person to see if was them only to find out it was Robin!
